# Health Assistant - Disease Prediction System

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the likelihood of diseases such as **Heart Disease**, **Lung Cancer**, **Kidney Disease**, and **Breast Cancer** using trained Machine Learning models.

## Features
- Predict **Heart Disease**, **Lung Cancer**, **Kidney Disease**, and **Breast Cancer** based on input parameters.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface powered by **Streamlit**.
- Trained models loaded using **Pickle** for efficient predictions.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/health-assistant.git
cd health-assistant

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Directory Structure
Ensure the following directory structure is maintained:
```
/project_root
    ├── app.py
    ├── saved_models/
    │   ├── heart_disease_model.sav
    │   ├── lung_cancer_model.sav
    │   ├── kidney_disease_model.sav
    │   └── breast_cancer_model.sav
    ├── requirements.txt
    └── README.md
```

### Run the Application
Execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
1. Open your browser at the URL provided by Streamlit (typically `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Use the sidebar to navigate between the different disease prediction options.
3. Input the required parameters for the disease you want to predict.
4. View the prediction results on the main page.

## Models
The following machine learning models are used for disease prediction:
- **Heart Disease**: Logistic Regression
- **Lung Cancer**: Decision Tree
- **Kidney Disease**: Random Forest
- **Breast Cancer**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Note
Ensure that the trained models are stored in the `saved_models/` directory. These models should be serialized using **Pickle** and compatible with Python.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required:
- Streamlit
- streamlit-option-menu
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas

## Acknowledgments
- This project uses publicly available datasets for training models.
- Inspired by real-world healthcare challenges to provide early disease detection.

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT License. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute it.
